# Week 4 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
A method in Ruby is similar to a function in JavaScript in the way that they both perform actions and hold logic for the program. Ruby methods also have implicit returns meaning that information is automatically returned without having to code "return" like in JavaScript.

#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer]
A child class that inherits from a parent class gets passed down the parents information and methods. Ruby inheritance works in a hierarchy of the superclass that has the most defining factors and more specialized classes that branch from the superclass add their own class specific details.

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```

The #{} is called string interpolation or (string literal?) and it accomplishes the act of passing in the variable "x" into a string without having to concatenating.

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
I feel pretty good with testing currently. I see a potential barrier in not knowing how to break my program or not thinking in ways that would break it.

#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?
