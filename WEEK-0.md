#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is made to be reusable and it's where all the logic happens.
#### 2. What is a method?
Things you want to have happen to a specific variable.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.toUpperCase .toLowerCase .length .charAt
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
A mutator method is to change an object and an accessor is to access an objects property.

If you only want to access an object then you would use an accessor and if you wanted to change an object you'd use a mutator.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
return is to return a value while console.log() is used as a dev tool to see the returned value.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
It was hard to visualize it when there was no examples and just was written out.


I really liked seeing a few examples, rather than one, to really understand how the certain code worked and ran. Also, really liked when we would incorporate other things we had already learned into the new topic. eg: reusing the code from the vowels examples in the toonimals examples in WEEK-0.js
