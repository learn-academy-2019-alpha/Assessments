#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is like a machine where you input an argument(s) and depending on you set the conditions too the function will return what you tell it to. And you would want to use a function because they are reusable.
#### 2. What is a method?
A not exactly sure how to describe a method but basically it's a behavior or action you want something to do. For example, if wanted to find the length of the variable greeter which equals the string "Hello" by using the method .length it'll find the length. greeter.length
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
I'm sure there is way more out there but these are some we covered and some I found.
.length       .search()
.indexOf()    .substring()
.split()      .substr()
.sort()       .slice()
.join()       .replace()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
An accessor gets information of the datatype while a mutator actually changes the datatype value permanently.
You would want to use an accessor if you wanted for example the length of an array or the value of an index inside the array. And you would use a mutator if you want to change the actual array, so for instance if you want to change an element inside the way you would use .replace(array[3] === 'what the new value is') keep in mind this permanently changes the array.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() is a function while return is a keyword. console.log actually prints so developer can see if its working while return wont print.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
Just working with my partner we would explain stuff to each other if one of didn't get something
