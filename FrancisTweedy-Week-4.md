#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?

Methods in Ruby are basically the same as functions in Javascript.  They are bundles of functionality that can be easily run elsewhere in the code.  The syntax is the main difference.

#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer
RSpec is the testing tool for Ruby.  The general process is to declare the test with comment, give the test the success condition and see if it passes.
//Googled Answer
RSpec is composed of multiples libraries that are used in Behavior Driven Developement to test Ruby code.

#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
Having a testing suite will be extremely useful for testing the code.  The test can be made much more elaborate without changing anything in the actual code.  The cons/barriers is the limitations on the input.  It will be difficult to do multi-step testing.

#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)


Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.
