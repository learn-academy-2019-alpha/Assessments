#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function performs a task (ideally only one) and makes code reusable. Factory.

#### 2. What is a method?
A built in function; i.e. strings and arrays have methods "built in' by the language. these methods, like other functions, perform a set task and are reusable.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.charAt
.includes
.indexOf
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
mutator methods manipulate the original data. accessor methods simply retrieve or get the data. mutators are "setters" and accessors, "getters". depending on the action you are trying to perform, either could be useful. mutators make me nervous:)
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log is for the developer and prints code to the console. one of my favorite things i learned this week, through some random googling, is that console is an object and .log() is a method. makes sense.

return passes (returns) the value from the function and stops the function from running
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
code challenges. so fun. trying to figure things out. watching the return. just practice practice practice.
