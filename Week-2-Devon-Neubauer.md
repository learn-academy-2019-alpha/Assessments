# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

You use .map() to create a new array with the actions of a function being performed on each element in the original function. You use .filter() in order to create a new array which filters out certain parameters defined in the function.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Destructuring is used to identify information with-in an object which then can be called or used with in functions - i.e. name, age, color, etc.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

* var is a global variable that can be used globally
* let is a variable that can only be used within a function
* const is a variable that can be used globally or with in a function, but it's original value can not be changed once declared.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is the process of identifying bugs in the code and making sure that the program runs as intended.

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is like a parent function. It contains a function with-in a function. you can pass functions through as an argument and also return functions.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Objects are part of a class. Classes define the overall variables that are generic for the objects it contains (i.e. name, color, size). Object set the values to the variables that are set in the class. (i.e. name: Devon, color: red, size: large)

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

I don't believe we did a group project. But I did take a lot away from the extended lectures that Matt did where we worked through certain problems as a group.


### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

CSS classes are used to style HTML elements. They are a set of visual styling elements that are grouped together and then assigned to these elements. Classes are used on elements where you will use them over and over again through out your page or program. IDs are specifically attached to a single element and are only used one time.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

footer, table, form, row

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

Use Bootstrap, Use Flexbox, use flexible CSS variables which include percentages and relative measurements and are not specified in fixed pixels or widths.


### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

Front end development is the programing and development of the user facing side of the software and it is what the enduser physically sees and interactions with. Some specific skills that are important to be a front end developer are: 1. understanding logic and how to problem solve or construct complex operations; 2. have a good understanding of the product you are building and how the enduser will interact with it; 3. creative eye for styling pages and ensuring an enjoyable user experience; 4. Knowledge of programming languages and an adaptability to learn new programs and changes that are made to existing languages.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

Block scope is a term used to describe everything contained within a function. Often it is important to restrain variable's values and restrict other parts of the program from accessing (or even changing these values. ES6 has made added let and const to help make block scope even easier.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

Inheritance in programming can be described much like inheritance is described in the human world. Traits (or values) can be passed on from a parent object or class.
