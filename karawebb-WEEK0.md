#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a statement in JavaScript that takes a value in order to execute a procedure or task, it has two parts a declaration and a call. You would want to use a function if there is a problem you want solved or an argument you want passed and you can call it in your program by using the return and in order to check that your function is being read/passed you can console.log it.   
#### 2. What is a method?
A method can be a built in function that is preexisting code that executes built in features already in JavaScript. There is also method which is to refer to an action that is preformed on an object but is also the objects “function” from what I understand.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
String is a datatype on javascript that takes “  ”and is normally text
“this is a string”
“thisisastring?”
“string” + “ “ + “this”
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor method only alters the array or object while mutator permanently alters the array, you’d use one if you want to be able to call your original array without being altered and a mutator would be if you are adding new data or the original set of data no longer needs to be accessed or used
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
Console.log can be called whenever and is used as a debugging tool that only communicates through your desktop terminal and shows the output of your functions, while a return is only used once and won’t show you any information when you run it through terminal or the command prompt for PC.
return would only be during certain statements while console.log() can show you a number of outputs.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
I think that just going through the different applications of how to do things and running them in different forms i.e. talking about it verbally, then seeing it visually, then getting to practice hands on is really helpful and puts the information in multiple perspectives which I personally believe helps to give a more comprehensive understanding on how things work together.
