# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1.  What is the difference between .map() and .filter() ?
    Both map and filter return without affecting the original array/data. The only difference is that filter filters out the specific data that you are seeking while map does something to each item in an array and return the same number of items.

    2. Why use distructuring?
    Distructuring an object can prevent you from having to repeat yourself. It's very useful especially if you have a very long code, it saves you tedious work.

3.  What is the difference between var, let, and const?
    var, let, and const are all used for function declaration in javascript.
    The difference is that var is function scoped and a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program;
    let allows us to declare a local variable in block scoped;
    const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned.
    The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.


4.  Why is testing important?
    It helps to detect bugs and helps in releasing a stable application.
    Testing also helps in early detection of bugs before merging it to production which
    can save you time at the end.

5.  What is a higher order function?
    A higher order function is a function that takes or returns a function as an argument.

6.  What is the difference between a class and an object?
    A class is a template for objects. A class defines object attributes and behaviors. An object has a
    state in which all of its properties have keys and values.


7.  What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1.  How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

    <head>
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
    </head>

2.  What is the difference between a div and a span?
    The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

    The span and div tags apply no meaning at all but is used in conjunction with CSS.

3.  What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
    In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by  (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

4.  Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

    <div></div>, <span></span>, <h1></h1>, <p></p>

5.  What are three options for creating responsive design?
    Meta element, using the max-width propery on css, and the <picture> element.

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1.  What is front end development? Can you identify any tools skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
    Front end development is when creating data for the user to view and to interact with. You would use  HTML, CSS and JavaScript and react to do so.
2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
   Block scoping allows you to maintain an assigned variable with in the block of code. the variable can only be used inside that block code.

3.  How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
    Inheritance allows us to inherit same traits from the parent class.
