# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map() goes over each element of an array and does something determined within the map function.
.filter() goes over each element of an array and filters out those elements that meet logic built into the function.
Filter returns a new array where as map does not.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Object destructuring helps make the process of using your objects within React much easier to use. Avoiding the
need for using this.state on your objects.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Var is globally scoped unless defined within a function. Let is block scoped bounded by the curly braces. Const is declared as a constant value. Because it is constant, it cannot be updated or redefined.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important because it tests real world inputs/actions/events against your code. It's also important because
you cannot depend on the console to throw you an error to find all your problems. Testing solidifies your functionality and overall code.

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that has higher order over a function that is declared within it.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

An object is an instance of a class. A class defines object properties.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

I believe this question is pertaining to the color box, lightbulb, and treasure hunt projects. These projects really allowed me to learn React a lot quicker than I thought we would. I have a long ways to go with React and it was frustrating at times, it forces the syntax and overall logic into your head over and over which I believe is a good thing.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

A div is usually used when you're going to have a line break after it as where span is typically used for inline.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

A CSS class assigns a broad class to specific elements that will all take the same styles. An id is much more specific, typically used when you want to style a couple elements at most.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

<p> - Paragraph
<ul> - Unordered List
<h1> - First level headline
<strong> - Strong emphasis

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

- You can set the viewpoint within your HTML.
- Use media queries within your CSS.
- Bootstrap

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

Front end development is the part part of the development process that handles the visitor side of the application. If the visitor sees, interacts, or uses any features within the application, that is the front end portion of the development process.

Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap are a few languages/tools that are used for front end development.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

Block scope is the scope of things within the curly braces itself. Anything defined within the block scope is only available within that block scope.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

Inheritance allows new objects to take on the properties of other objects within object oriented programming.
