# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
    Both .map() and .filter() use built-in loops, but .map() returns every element in an array, while .filter() only returns the elements that meet the requirements set in the filter method.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?
    Object destructuring is very useful because it allows you to create references to an object's properties that can be called upon at any point throughout your code.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
    var can be used to define variables that can be re-assigned at any point in the program, while let can be used within the scope of a function or block of code that performs the same task.  const is used to define a variable that will not change at all.

4. Why is testing important?
    Testing is important because it allows you to discover errors in your code that may not have been found otherwise.

5. What is a higher order function?
    A higher order function is a function that takes in another function as an argument or returns a function.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
    A class sets up the basic structure of an object. It defines the object's attributes and behaviors.  An object is an instance of a class. The object acts on the behaviors that were set forth in its class.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
    I learned a lot about React this week, although I feel that the challenges were too advanced. I appreciated the walk-throughs of the code because they helped me to absorb the material better.


### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?
    You link a CSS file to your HTML page by including a link tag within the HTML page's head element with the name of your CSS file.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
    A div element is used to define a block of code, therefore multiple div elements cannot occupy the same line. A span element is generally nested within another element in the same line and multiple span elements can occupy one line.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
    A CSS class is used to define a group of elements that will have the same styling. You should use an id instead of a class when you want to define a certain style for one specific element.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.
    Some semantic HTML tags are: <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>.

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?
    -Using a grid or a flex-box structure for your pages
    -Using media queries to specify stylings for devices of varying sizes or types
    -Creating separate style sheets for different devices or screen sizes

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
    Front end development refers to the appearance of a website or application. Skills that would be useful for this would be graphic design, photoshop, or anything along those lines.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
    Block scope refers to a group of code that performs a specific task or returns something.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
    Inheritance is the concept of one class acquiring the characteristics and behaviors of another class. The class that inherits is considered the "child class", while the class that the child class inherits from is called the "parent class".
