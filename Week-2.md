so it is easier to reference later in code.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
I learned that working in groups can be very helpful so long as you keep yourself included and make sure you are doing work yourself too, so that you are actually learning what other people are teaching you and not just watching what they know how to do.
