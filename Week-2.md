# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

map is a mutator and filter is an accessor. Meaning map will permanently alter your array while filter will just make the array smaller or filter through it and the out put to the new array won't change the original one.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Its helpful to put the code in most up to date JavaScript, but I think I am still a little fuzzy on destructuring that’s when you can unpack the information in an array or ?

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

They can all be used to set variables var is normally used more locally I believe not the best practice for newest JS and const is probably best practice to use because it is a more global and can’t or won’t be reassigned let is normally used for stating that a change is about to happen or can make changes to the value.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important because it can run/ account for all the possibilities or outcomes of code a head of time and if for some reason it won’t work or has a bug it pinpoints where that is and it can be fixed so that when you actually execute it in your program everything will run smoothly. Also is important practice so if you ever have a company that is heavy into testing that you know how!

5. What is a higher order function?


6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

An object is an array of data types and a class has an identifier and can be an array but also can have an array of objects in it. Can also use class to group multiple pieces of information together
