# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

###1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
.filter() takes an array and returns a new array with what passed a certain test of what specific things you want.  eg: filter through to return those who are left handed in this object

.map() maps through the array to see if each item, element can successfully go through the function. eg: map through to find the numbers' roots

###2. Why would you use object destructuring?

~1. To make it easier to write the code throughout the doc since this.state.color can just be referenced with color.

~2. It's easier to read both for you and also someone reading your code for the first time.

~3. Saves a lot of time to destructure and it's more convenient.


###3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var is used to set something you can either use for have that var to be reachable in the entire page or just within a function. Also, you can always re declare that var which is handy.

let is something that became more used than var as it sets a block scope. Basically, once you use let to declare something that can only be used within {} functions. Also, you can update let but cannot re declare it like var at least within its scope.

cost is just setting something to be have a constant value and it maintains that because it cant be re declared or even updated. It also can only be used within the block it was declared in.

###4. Why is testing important?
Testing helps you find bugs, cover all the possible entries, solutions, and outcomes as well as making sure it meets all the things you want your code to execute.

Its really important to work those kinks out with multiple tests rather than make a site live and have the users come across what could've been caught in the test phase.

###5. What is a higher order function?
A function that can take in another function as an argument. Eg: map and filter are higher order functions because they are taking in a function as the argument and executing that method to the array.

###6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
class is the template in which helps create the object or objects to within it. Objects are what have their own properties and values.

###7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
I think I learned the most from doing the Dice with my partner because we both understood each other and how to work through it. It was really satisfying to get it together and bounce back and forth to complete the logic and also to just make sure we both understood it.

Like almost everyone in class the Treasure Hunt game was the toughest. My partner and I in that really struggled. Neither of us got it, even after asking for help we still couldn't understand it, and it didn't help that half the class thought what we needed to do and how the structure was suppose to look like was entirely different than the other half of the class.

Going off that it was really frustrating to spend that entire day with no end project anywhere in sight. Especially since we had gotten the alert to work then it broke in someway that we couldn't understand and eventually parted ways on our own devices.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

###1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

with a rel="stylesheet" and link to the actual css page

###2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

a div is used to contain a certain chunk of code together while a span is used for a really small chunk of code.

##3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

id should only be used once per page per unique id name while classes can be assigned to various amounts of your code with the same name as well as using that class on the same class multiple times on the same element.

I would use classes to further manipulate in CSS while an id is something you'd give to a single element so it can take a certain style.

##4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.
1. Footer 2. Header 3. Nav 4. Table 5. Section

##5. What are three options for creating responsive design?
### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

#1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

Front end development is what the user will see and interact with. Its the visuals and interface of the website, app, idea.

I think having great verbal skills are needed in the sense of talking to the clients as to what they want or even to just communicate what they need specifically done whether it's CSS to center an item from the nav bar or to speak with the back end developers to make sure the information users are entering is being stored correctly and not get "lost".

Also, they need to be, to an extent, quick on your feet to be able to adjust and or adapt to fix the bug, ticket, issue quickly enough to satisfy the customer and also that not too many people discover it after it's brought to the attention of the developers.  

#2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
As I understand it block scope in Javascript is what happens in the {} braces of a function when you use let/const in ES6.  

#3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

Think of a family. The parents have certain traits and their children will share some of those. They can inherit the skin color, eye color, the way they speak, etc. In a sense we're also creating a hierarchy.

New objects inherit from the objects that already exist. This helps objects inherit certain things to let them become reusable as well as have their own unique traits too.
