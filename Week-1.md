# Week 1 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. List the data types in Javascript. Indicate which are primitives.
Boolean, numbers, string, null, undefined, symbols and objects, I believe they are all primitive except for objects which are non primitives.

2. What's the difference between =, ==, and === in JavaScript?
= is best to use when you are setting a variable or creating a new function or some kind of object  where place holders are often used and there isn’t an exact defining property, == will get you an outcome of an equation or function but wont always be accurate,  will be a little “buggy” you could say. The === is the absolute value stating whatever comes first has to equal the value defined after the triple equal sign.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and length?
The arrays index logs the spots an item takes up in an array and the count is starting at zero while the length just accounts for the length of variables or items in the array so it will have an index of 5 but a length of 6.

4. What are the three parts of a for loop?
for(let i= 0; i<array.lenght; i++)
first part means where you want to set the start of your loop at in the array, second part defines what the loop is doing or looking for, and the third is at what speed or increment it is looping through the array at

5. What is a function's declaration, argument, and call?
The function’s declaration is what the name of it is and how it runs. The argument is something that is passed through the function to make it work, gives it information to process and the call is making sure that the information that is being passed is actually returning an answer and pulling out what we are telling it to do.

6. What are the three main steps in saving work to github?
Git add . to update a whole folder, git commit -m  git push, when the repo has already been connected

7. What is the terminal command to move directories?
cd

8. Do you have a suggestion for a Check In question?


9. What was your favorite topic this week?
I enjoyed testing a lot and introduction to wireframing with websites in Pig Latin

10. What was your "A-ha!" moment this week?
Didn't have a specific one. I think Friday having everything come together and getting time to work on assesments showed me that I knew more than I thought.
### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. Look at this Javascript and try to predict, what will the browser's console show?

``` javascript
var text = 'outside'
function logIt(){
    console.log(text)
    var text = 'inside'
}

logIt()
```

2. What is JSON? How does it relate to javascript objects?

3. Describe a closure, what is it good for and how do you recognize one?
