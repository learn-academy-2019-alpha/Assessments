#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function are instructions telling the computer how to do a task.
#### 2. What is a method?
Methods is an actions performed on an object.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
"hello".charAt(1) -> "e"

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Mutators change the original array and accessors access the array but don't change the original. You might use one method over the other depends on what you're trying to achieve in your outcomes. For example, if you want to add a value to the end of your array you'd use .push (mutator). If you wanted to merge two arrays together to combine them you'd use .concat (accessor). It depends on if you're trying to temporarily change your array and permanently change it.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log is used more for the programmer to see and check that their work is running. console.log prints to the console. Return passes the value back up to where it was made. You'd use console.log to check your work and return to pass a value.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
One thing we did in class that helped me learn the most was going over functions after they were already written out and explaining each piece. It's kind of hard to understand when we're watching in lecture and it's written out with everyone's input but then not explained at the end. When we dissect each step it becomes much more clear. Overall, great instructors and great teaching methods.
