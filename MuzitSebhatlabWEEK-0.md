#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
JavaScript string methods fall in to two catagories; mutators and accessors.
length, indexOf, reverse, push/pop, shift/unshift, sort, concat, join, splice, and split are some of the few.

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Mutator methods change or mutate the original array or data. While accessor methods return data without affecting the original array.
You would choose one method over the other depending on if you want to change or return  something from the array.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() logs information in the console
return outputs information that we can save an use later in the function.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
I realized you learn more by working alone than in a group or team setting. It also helped me a lot when instructors go through examples slowly and step by step.
